					<p class="story-text justify-text">Animation has been a cinematic genre relatively early in the history of film, with the first animated "film" appearing in 1906.
						This film, <i>Humorous Phases of Funny Faces</i>, is shown at right. Early animated films were of this style (flipbook-style reels of black-and-white drawings)
						for a whileâ€”even synchronized sound and color weren't widely incorporated into animated movies until the 1920s.
						<br><br>
						Considering, though, the fact that animated movies are just over a century old, it's clear that
						<b>animation has undergone a remarkable evolution.</b> As animation technology has developed from stop-motion pictures of a chalkboard to hours-long computer-animated features,
						the cultural impact of animation has developed in turn. In particular, animated movies have become more popular and more profitable over time, establishing animation as an important
						genre in Hollywood.

						Animation has clearly been profitable in terms of budget-to-profit ratio.
						Despite this, though, animation has only enjoyed widespread commercial success within the last few decades.
						<br><br>
						Animation's recent commercial success in America is in large part to the <b>Disney Renaissance</b>,
						a period starting in the '80s when Disney produced a series of animated films (often based on well-known stories) that were critically and commercially successful.
						In fact, nine of the ten movies of this period were nominated for Oscars, and <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> made history by becoming the first animated movie to be nominated for Best Picture.
						In the next visualization, one can explore the top ten films in the box office by year, and see the increasing commercial success of animation over time.

					<p class="justify-text"> Looking at the years after 1975, one can see that animation didn't break the top ten grossing movies until "An American Tail" in 1986. Two years afterwards came "Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"
						then the Disney Renaissance took effect the succeeding year with "The Little Mermaid." Since then, most of the top-grossing animated movies have been made by Disney and/or Pixar. </p>

						Looking at IMDB data, one can also see audience responses to animated movies.
						Interestingly, despite the success of animated movies in the box office (indicating a large audience demand for animated movies), average IMDB ratings for animated movies are somewhere in the middle compared to other genres.
						According to IMDB, the highest rated animated film is Spirited Away directed by the reputed Hayao Miyazaki.

						As you can see, despite animation's success at the box office, and the leaps it's made as a genre, there is evidence of others not taking animation seriously.
						The quotes at right are from Oscar voters, when asked about how they voted for Best Animated Feature.
					</p>
					<p class="story-text justify-text">
						The downplaying of animation is largely due to the conception of animation as a niche genre at best, and a genre only valuable for children at worst.
						This, however, isn't a fair conception. While many animated movies are family-friendly, this isn't the case for all animation.
						In fact, animated movies can interact with genres like science fiction, action, and drama.
						Given the wide array of genres with which animation interacts, <b>it'd be more accurate to identify animation as a medium rather than a genre</b>, and not have preconceived notions of animation as "only for kids."
